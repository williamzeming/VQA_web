Aircore Drilling
The reconnaissance aircore drilling program was designed to test the lithologies of
interpreted felsic volcanic sequence in E45/2381 for the suitability for VMS host
rocks. The holes were drilled alongside existing roads that crossed the interpreted
felsic volcanic package within the relinquished portion of E45/2381. A total of 29
holes were drilled for 1126m and 260 composite samples were collected.
The tenement has an unconsolidated cover of silt, sand, gravel and cobbles,
overlying the basement lithologies, varying in thickness from 3m in the southern
portion of the tenement, increasing towards the north up to 56m. The basement
lithologies intersected were felsic volcanics and associated high level porphyry
intrusives, and minor epiclastic to volcaniclastic sediments.
Spacing between drill holes was initially 500m and some infill holes were completed
down to 125m spacing. Large composite samples were collected for the cover (10m)
and basement samples were taken as 4m composites. The palaeosol
(cover/basement interface) was sampled as a 1m to 2m interval sample.
Several holes intersected anomalous basement lithologies particularly GTA005 and
GTA008. GTA005 and GTA008 had results of 1200 ppm Zn, 382 ppm Pb in an
epiclastic/volcaniclastic basement and 1970 ppm Zn within the hematite altered
rhyolite (?) basement respectively.
These results are quite significant, as the aim of the drilling was to confirm the extent
of the felsic volcanic package, and to return samples that are anomalous in base
metals indicates the presence of these metals in the felsic volcanic package.
