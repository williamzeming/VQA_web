content: This is the first partial surrender report submitted for tenement E28/1187 which was granted on 11/5/2005.  \n E28/1187 is part of the Kalpini Project; originally acquired by Heron Resources Ltd (Heron) because it was \n considered to be prospective for gold and nickel on the basis of the project area’s proximity to the Emu Fault \n Zone, the Kalpini and Wellington gold mining centres, and the occurrence of a komatiite belt in the eastern \n prospect area.  \nThe Kalpini Project is incorporated within Heron’s larger Kalgoorlie Nickel Project (KNP) which is subject to a \n farm-in agreement with Inco Australia Limited Partnership (IALP).   \nDuring the period 1997-2004, three major campaigns of RC drilling, preliminary metallurgical testwork and a \n resource estimate were completed on the Project by Heron. During the 2004 – 2005 reporting period the Ni \n laterite  resource  was  recalculated  by  Snowdens  Consultants  who  used  using  block  modelling  techniques \n and a bottom Ni cut-off grade of 0.5% to estimate the total Mineral Resource at Kalpini at 76.4Mt grading \n 0.73% Ni and 0.044% Co (Snowdens, 2004).   \nWork  completed  on  the  portion  of  E28/1187  that  has  been  surrendered  focussed  on  nickel  laterite  and \n included field reconnaissance, data compilation, a review of regional geology and the acquisition and review \n of regional multiclient aeromagnetic data as part of a review of the Kalpini Project as a whole. This report \n details these works. \n'}
